Only use unlicensed or free to use sources for examples, images, or any external components.

I use HomeAssistant as my home automation hub. It can be found at `https://homeassistant.service.burdick.dev`.
I prefer HomeAssistant examples as yaml snippets.
I prefer Zigbee, however I do have Zwave, ESPHome, and wifi-based devices.

I use Unifi for my home networking, with separate networks for IoT devices.
I use PiHole for my home dns, with a primary (dns-00.service.burdick.dev) and secondary (dns-01.service.burdick.dev)

I use Proxmox for any virtual machines, and Docker + Komodo (komodo.iot.burdick.dev) for container hosting.
